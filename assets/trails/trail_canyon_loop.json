Canyon Loop is a short but stunningly beautiful 20 minute lap.From either parking lot or the Betasso Link Trail, take the Canyon Loop Trail in the required direction. Both directions are fun and the county usually changes the required direction on the 1st of every month. You start at a high point and descend about half way before climbing back up to where you started. The trail is bench cut on a steep slope. So although the trail is technically pretty easy, it can cause problems for those with a tendency for vertigo. Most of the trail is pleasant singletrack, relatively flowy, and about 3 feet wide, but perhaps 1/4 of the loop is on the historic Betasso Ranch road. There's an incredible overlook counterclockwise from the trailhead, less than a mile along the trail that overlooks Boulder Canyon with great views of the the University of Colorado and the city.</p>Important stuff you should know:<b> </b>This trail is closed to bikes on Wednesdays and Saturdays This trail has a  required direction for bike traffic at all times (look for the arrow when you get on the trail)Trail direction changes on the 1st of the month<p><b>Please obey these  rules</b> and BMA will continue to work within the political process to make  the system work better.</p><p>Betasso Preserve is one of the few places to get in a mountain bike ride  from town without the use of a car. Ride  up the Boulder Creek Path, which goes through town and up Boulder  Canyon to the intersection with Fourmile Canyon. Then you have to jockey  with traffic on Boulder Canyon Drive (Highway 119) to the Betasso Link Trail, or you can head up Fourmile Canyon to the Fourmile Connector Trail.</p>", "elevation_gain": 137.16, "cool_rating": 2.0, "difficulty_rating": 3, "tech_rating": 1.5, "id": "217", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Canyon Loop", "length": 5149.888, "aerobic_rating": 2.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/betasso2lg.jpg", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.344596863, 40.016475677]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
