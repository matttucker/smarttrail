"1478", "description": "<p>Lower Bitterbrush (we've divided the trail into two sections here,  because of the very Jekyll and Hydeian nature of these two sections and  because they meet the Antelope Trail right where things change) is an  awesome technical trail to sharpen your skills before heading out on a  trip to Moab! The Lower Bitterbrush Trail is marked with the blood and  broken derailleurs of a generation of riders. If you are an advanced  rider or want to be one, this is your playground! Before I go further, I  think it's best to recall that whole \"discretion is the better part of  valor\" thing (bet you weren't expecting a Shakespeare quote on a trails  site, were you?). This trail is HARD, but there aren't really many  surprises here. If something looks too tough for you to try today -  don't. Very few riders can \"clean\" this trail and those that do often  wreck trying. Have fun, ride hard, be careful! Heading up this trail is  the ultimate interval workout where you will go from maximum effort 20  ft climb to maximum effort 20ft climb with about 10ft of flat recovery  for a good section of this trail.\u00a0 The Lower Bitterbrush starts  at the Bitterbrush trailhead and seems innocuous enough at the  beginning. Head out of the west end of the parking lot up a short  section of newly restored trail that winds around big boulders heading  north. Enjoy the smooth singletrack as the trail then heads west again  and crosses a maintenance road. The first rocky section begins shortly.  From here, the trail winds up a gnarly rock garden for close to a mile  that will either make you smile from ear to ear or need to change your  shorts depending on your comfort level with riding up big rocks, through  narrow cracks, over roots, and up steep slopes. You know you  are coming to the top when you get to a prairie dog town. In the spring,  this is a great place for wildflowers (thanks to the prairie dogs that  help disperse seeds and prep the landscape for wildflowers!). The top of  the hill has a bench on it, so feel fee to stop for a snack. Lower Bitterbrush only continues for a couple hundred more yards down a  stepped (with rock steps spaced far, so easy to ride) trail down to the  intersection of Antelope and Upper Bitterbrush.</p><p><i><b>Coming back down:</b></i>Lower  Bitterbrush is a blast to ride down! It's a killer full-body workout  keeping your bike upright over the interesting rock obstacles out there.  Be careful about getting too much air here: this descent has claimed  more than one rear rim of mine as I landed pointy rocks that make great  tacos! Because the trail is so jankety and because so many people use  it, always keep your eyes forward and your speed way under control. Keep  your butt back over the rear wheel and enjoy the trip down.</p><p>Directions to the trailhead:</p>TrailheadPark at Sandstone Park in downtown Lyons and ride in", "elevation_gain": 198.12, "cool_rating": 3.5, "difficulty_rating": 5, "tech_rating": 4.5, "id": "175", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Lower Bitterbrush", "length": 3701.4819999999995, "aerobic_rating": 4.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/IMG_0270.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.289505005, 40.212127686]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
