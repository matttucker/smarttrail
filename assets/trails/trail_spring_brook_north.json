not too steep, not too flat, juuuuussst right.\u00a0 The trail isn't very technical either, with few  rocks (relative to other Boulder County trails) and nice, smooth sections.</p><p>From Dowdy Draw, you start Spring Brook with 0.3 miles of singletrack over to a 3-way intersection with Spring Brook North to your right, and Spring Brook South to your left.\u00a0 Which way to go?\u00a0 You can take the loop either direction, as both directions offer a nice climb with a twisty descent.\u00a0 Since this is the Spring Brook <i>North</i> description, let's go right!</p><p>The climb winds along contour, with meadow views to your right and downhill.\u00a0 There are a couple of corners marked with \"slow - blind corner\", and the signs are serious.\u00a0 Other than that the sight lines are awesome on this trail, you can see other trail users from a good distance away and get ready to practice some seriously awesome yielding skills.\u00a0 The climb temporarily tops out on a flat meadow, with one of the most killer views of the Flatirons you get - it's why we live here, baby!\u00a0 Climbers will appreciate the views of the Mickey Mouse Wall, and you'll occasionally catch a glimpse of trains going up the grade on their way to Rollins Pass.\u00a0 Take a moment to soak in the view.</p><p>After turning back south, you enter the forest and enjoy some loamy trail with twists and turns through the trees.\u00a0 This trail is a great place to work on your handling skills while avoiding blowing out the corners.\u00a0 At the top of the climb, you come to a trail intersection sign and will see a path to the right that connects you up to a  service road and to some hiking trails. While you might be tempted,  please DO NOT ride any of the hiking only trails. This only hurts the reputation of all mountain bikers, and therefore endangers our access. Instead, continue on the loop to  the left and head back down on Spring Brook South. This is a nice descent with some small  loose rocks. Be carefull and respectull to hikers - this area tends to  have a lot of foot traffic. Please slow and give way. If you have a  bell, even better!</p><p>One of the newest trails in the Open Space and Mountain Parks system, Spring Brook opened in 2009.\u00a0 With the allure of this beautiful trail, scenery, and the opportunity for a longer loop-style ride, more mountain bikers started using the Dowdy Draw area.\u00a0 Boulder Mountainbike Alliance and the Boulder Mountain Bike Patrol consequently stepped up their efforts in this area, working harder than ever to educate all trail users about ettiquete and proper yielding technique.\u00a0 Check out the Bike Patrol for information on their educational efforts, and BMA's trail etiquette page.</p>", "elevation_gain": 82.296, "cool_rating": 3.0, "difficulty_rating": 3, "tech_rating": 2.0, "id": "270", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Spring Brook North", "length": 2253.0759999999996, "aerobic_rating": 2.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/IMG_0830b_1.jpg", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.259750366, 39.923973083]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
