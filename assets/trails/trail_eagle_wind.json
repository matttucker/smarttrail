"<p>Eagle wind is a nice 4 mile intermediate trail at Rabbit Mountain Open Space Park. It's got a little bit of everything: easy switchbacks, rocky sections and some great turns. It\u2019s also well marked so you won\u2019t get lost. It's short, but has good elevation gain without ever getting too steep. Most of the trail is single track with only short sections of dirt/fire road. If you are looking for a great ride to practice your skills and get more comfortable riding on the kind of trails we have here in Boulder County, look no further!</p><p><b>Early season note:</b> This is often one of the first Boulder County trail systems to dry out, so early season it may be the only place to ride when the other trails are wet and all mud.</p><p>The trail starts out going up some great intermediate single track. Beginner\u2019s option: if this is too difficult ride across the flats with some great views of prairie dogs and turn left up the dirt road and ride it up a steep hill about 4/10th of a mile to the trail junction. At the Eagle Wind sign turn right to do the lollypop. or turn left to go down some sweet single track back to the trail head.</p><p>After you reached the top of the trail about 0.5 miles if you go straight you will be on the Little Thompson Trail, so go right to stay on Eagle Wind. You will cross the road the beginners took to get to the trail. After going a 0.5 mile you will reach the loop. This trail is fun in either direction. The loop has no major changes in elevation and just a few technical sections. After completing the loop it\u2019s all down hill enjoy.</p>", "elevation_gain": 198.12, "cool_rating": 2.5, "difficulty_rating": 3, "tech_rating": 2.5, "id": "274", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Eagle Wind", "length": 5632.69, "aerobic_rating": 2.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/DSC_2772_710.jpg", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.224046, 40.246482]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
