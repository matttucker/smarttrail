It makes a great connecter to Doudy Draw, and also completes a loop with its newer sibling the Flatirons Vista South Trail. You can also expect to see a fair number of prairie dogs, deer, and even coyotes if you keep your eyes open. You're rewarded with expansive views of the Flatirons, and also some of the Indian Peaks through Eldarado Canyon.</p>", "elevation_gain": 60.96, "cool_rating": 1.0, "difficulty_rating": 1, "tech_rating": 1.0, "id": "373", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Flatirons Vista North", "length": 1931.2079999999999, "aerobic_rating": 1.0, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/P5294191-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.235549927, 39.924301147]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
