To get to it, either ride up the Boulder Creek Path to where it dead ends at Fourmile Canyon and then jump onto Boulder Canyon Drive (Highway 119), or park at the head of the trail just before the tunnel on Boulder Canyon Drive.</p><p>It's 1 1/4 miles uphill - all uphill, steep, and very technical. The initial section follows the old water treatment pipeline, and is wide - but not easy. It's nearly always a loose &amp; sandy, and has several significant technical areas. And did we mention steep? Once the trail leaves the old pipeline allighnment, it gets far more narrow, and has numerous tight switchbacks. and eventually climbs to and crosses Betasso Road. Shortly after, the trail ends at the Canyon Loop Trail. Heed the directional arrow, and continue your ride.</p><p>While this trail technically could be ridden as a downhill shuttle, we highly recommend against doing so for two reasons: 1) this is a heavily used trail close to town and you're going to cause a stress to others with your\u00a0 downhill gear, and 2) the trail isn't that hard and you look a little foolish trying to play downhiller on a trail this uninspiring.</p>", "elevation_gain": 198.12, "cool_rating": 2.0, "difficulty_rating": 4, "tech_rating": 2.0, "id": "219", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Betasso Link", "length": 2011.675, "aerobic_rating": 4.0, "image_url": "http://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/101_2437-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.333381653, 40.007205963]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
