This trail is pretty mellow, wide  and only has a couple of easy rocky spots. It's the way up to the Nelson  Loop if you are planning on making a bigger ride out of your trip to  Hall. From the bench near the trail junction of Lower Bitterbrush and Antelope,  head west and downhill. This downhill is short followed by an uphill  that will take you past another great prairie dog town and onto the  ridge line. Over time, this trail has seen a lot of wear from the large  number of people on it. Please try to stay in the middle of the trail as  much as possible to allow for the singletrack to stay single.</p><p>This  trail tops out at the base of the Nelson Loop. You'll notice the trail  widening after a short section of roots and rocks. This is a popular  spot for hikers and bikers to catch their breath before heading up!</p><p><i><b>Coming down:</b></i>This  trail is a ripper on the way back down! It's got great flow for the  intermediate rider, with a lot of fun swoopy turns that really put a  smile on your face. Two words here. One, this trail has a lot of loose  sandy stuff on it. People regularly come down this trail too hot and  find themselves upside down before they can blink. Two, this is a super  popular trail with a lot of blind corners and a lot of people (many who  will be scared by bike riders coming downhill and likely unprepared to  avoid you). Keep your speed under control and be respectful. Going  downhill, you're the one who yields - and that doesn't mean riding off  the trail to avoid other people, man! It means slowing way the hell down  and stopping if necessary to make sure that uphill traffic isn't  afraid/startled/put out/killed.</p>", "elevation_gain": 109.72800000000001, "cool_rating": 2.5, "difficulty_rating": 3, "tech_rating": 2.5, "id": "176", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Upper Bitterbrush", "length": 2253.0759999999996, "aerobic_rating": 2.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/00201-1.jpg", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.305641174, 40.220302582]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
