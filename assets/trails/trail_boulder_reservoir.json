This initial elevation gain helps set the table for the next 10 minutes as the decent down the backside of this hill provides a nice fast ride through a small meadow leading to the underpass on US36. From there the rider turns left on Broadway St and spends some time on this unpaved hard packed dirt to arrive at the Eagle Trail which provides a section of fast single track leading to a steep, quick decent. The scenery in this area is stunning with the rider eventually arriving at N55th St. From there you turn left and join the Boulder Trail to travel along the fringe of the Boulder Reservoir towards Coot Lake. A right at this point continues the near circumnavigation of the lake to exit the reservoir at its main entrance. At this point the options are a left to head south on N51st to meet Jay Road and back in to town or a right which leads the rider back to N55th St where he or she can return west towards Dakota Ridge. All in all a wonderful 12 to 14 miles of mixed riding. Great evening ride after work.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "elevation_gain": 12.192, "cool_rating": 1.0, "difficulty_rating": 1, "tech_rating": 0.5, "id": "403", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Boulder Reservoir", "length": 1931.2079999999999, "aerobic_rating": 0.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/PA309155.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.206998, 40.08460576]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
