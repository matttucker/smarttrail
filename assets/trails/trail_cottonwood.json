It meanders along Whiterock  Ditch for most of its way, on its E/S sides for much of the northern  half, and on its W/S sides for the southern half.

Though it's on the NE edge of our bustling city, it has a wonderfully  bucolic feel.</p><p><b>Northern trailhead:</b> Jay Rd, 0.25 miles E of Diagonal/119; no parking is available here. <b>Southern trailhead:</b> Independence Rd, 0.75 miles E of Diagonal; parking is available here on the S side of Independence Rd. <b>Approximate length</b>: 1.25 miles <b>Difficulty: </b>Easy; there is no elevation gain/loss.</p><p>Other notes:</p>There is open space on one or both sides for all of its length.On the S side of the bridge, a connection to the E terminus of the  Fourmile Creek pathway can be had by hike-a-biking over the railroad  tracks.Continuing S from Independence, it becomes the Cottonwood Path.
