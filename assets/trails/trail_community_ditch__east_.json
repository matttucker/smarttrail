It parallels the Community Ditch and is level, wide, but with a natural surface - so it can be a bit rocky at times.</p><p>Starting from where it crosses Highway 93, the trail also connects with the upper end of the Coal Seam Trail. Heading east, the trail meanders following the ditch, offering great views of Boulder and the Flatirons to the north, as well as a chance to see deer, coyotes, and more likely, some of the cows that frequent the area.</p><p>The first intersection you come to is on your right, with a bridge over the ditch. This trail climbs up to the Greenbelt Plateau, and the section you see from the intersection is the toughest part of the trail. The next intersection, to the north, is a hiking only trail. Finally, you'll come along to the end of the trail, and the intersections of Marshall Valley Trail and Cowdrey Draw Trail. One other bonus at this end of the trail is the overlook to Marshall Lake. While there's no access to this private lake, it's another great place to see wildlife and take in the views.</p>", "elevation_gain": 1.524, "cool_rating": 1.0, "difficulty_rating": 1, "tech_rating": 0.5, "id": "388", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Community Ditch (East)", "length": 2092.142, "aerobic_rating": 1.0, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/P5294189.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.236305237, 39.946079254]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
