It's well marked so you won't get lost. Early season note: This trail has NO cover - you are always in the sun, and is the first place to dry out, so early season it may be the only place to ride when the other trails are wet and all mud.</p><p>This trail is an out and back that climbs steadily and ends at a gate that says \"trail  end here, private property.\" At this point you're looking at Larimer  County. This trail is a good option for cross bikes, there is nothing  technical about this trail. There are some good views and prairie dogs  to be seen, but this is not the best choice at Rabbit Mountain for mountain bikes.\u00a0 For some single track fun on the  way back turn left onto the Eagle Wind Trail.</p><p>To get to the trail head there are 2 options:</p>I'd recommend taking the Eagle Wind single track from the kiosk to the top. Once there you'll see a sign, go right, (if you go left, you are on Little Thompson). Follow this to the dirt road, when you get to the dirt road go left, in a little bit you'll see the sign that says Indian Mesa. The other option is taking the dirt road from the parking area, after climbing a 6%+ grade for just under a mile you'll arrive at the sign that's says Indian Mesa, the road changes from improved dirt to dirt/gravel. <p>This trail has motorized traffic (cars/farm vehicles), so keep your eyes open.</p>", "elevation_gain": 87.17280000000001, "cool_rating": 1.5, "difficulty_rating": 3, "tech_rating": 0.5, "id": "275", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Indian Mesa", "length": 2574.944, "aerobic_rating": 2.0, "image_url": "http://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/101_2437-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.217192521, 40.249600333]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
