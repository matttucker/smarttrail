This isn\u2019t singletrack nirvana. It is, however, a great section of trail to connect High Plains to the other Marshall Mesa trails. It is a really wide road with a little climb up to the top and a nice quick descent back down. If you just have to ride something skinny, there is a singletrack on the east side of the road for long stretches. Thanks to your friends here at BMA, that singletrack next to the road is officially legal to ride on. There is, however, one small section just off this trail that will test your skill. About halfway down the hill, look for a trail off to the right. This short connector has some water bars and some rocky steps. Beginners, watch your step! There are quite a few hikers out there, so please be courteous!</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "elevation_gain": 6.7056000000000004, "cool_rating": 1.0, "difficulty_rating": 1, "tech_rating": 0.5, "id": "265", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Greenbelt Plateau", "length": 2574.944, "aerobic_rating": 1.0, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/101_2437-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.232963, 39.92908]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
