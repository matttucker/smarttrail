Live up in North Boulder and want  to connect from Boulder Valley Ranch to points North? Well, this is a  trail for you! Yes, as of the writing of this description are heaps of gates to go through (think of it  as practice for cyclocross with all the dismounts/mounts you'll be  doing), but it's also singletrack!\u00a0 And in the near future, at least some o' these gates are going to be supplemented by ride-over cattle guards.\u00a0 In the winter, this trail is really  exposed so it dries out pretty quickly. In the summer, this trail is  really exposed, so you can practice your dehydration-weightloss plan  easily by riding on this trail midday!</p><p></p><p>Lefthand  Trail connects the Sage Trail at Lookout Rd. with Neva Rd at 39th (39th  is a dirt road, so it's a cool way to avoid all that yucky \"pavement\"  all the roadies talk about loving). The trail trucks along for just over  2 miles next to Lefthand Valley Reservoir and some great cattle grazing  land. From the Sage Trail, you can connect onto this trail by following  the signs at the Boulder Valley Ranch Trailhead. After going through a  somewhat confusing set of gates and splitting trails (just keep heading  North), you will quickly get rolling. There are a few minor twists and  turns and even a couple of small bridges to go over. If you are a  beginning mountain biker, this could be a great way to practice your  skills on an easy trail with very few people around to be embarrassed in front of!</p><p></p><p>From a wildlife standpoint, you'll  have great opportunities to see a largely unbounded prairie dog colony  (well several actually). These large ground squirrels are heaps of fun  to stop and watch (an excuse I use every time I'm tired and see some).  They are much smarter than their chubby little behinds portray and  actually have members of the colony standing guard against predators.  Each type of predator causes them to make a different call. While they  are known to make a \"human warning\", I'm not sure that they discriminate  between hikers and bikers (wouldn't it be nice if all humans thought  the same way?). During the spring and summer, you can also hear  meadowlarks calling regularly. Look for a tan and yellow bird about the  size of a Robin on fenceposts in the distance when you ride. Finally,  you are not too far away from known Bald Eagle, Osprey, and Red-tailed  Hawk nests. Keep an eye on the sky for these awesome hunters!</p><p></p>", "elevation_gain": 26.822400000000002, "cool_rating": 2.0, "difficulty_rating": 2, "tech_rating": 1.0, "id": "223", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Left Hand", "length": 4667.085999999999, "aerobic_rating": 1.0, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/IMG_2115.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.26368713, 40.10525513]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
