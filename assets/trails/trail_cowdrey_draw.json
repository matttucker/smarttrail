It's an important piece of the big Dirty Bismark loop.</p><p>This trail features some of the newer IMBA style trail construction techniques. What's that mean to you? It's narrower than most of the other trails in the area, and twists and turns while slightly undulating up and down to shed water. This style is also a ton of fun with a flow of it's own. Cowdry Draw is nearly level, and benched in tightly with the hillside. In order to keep it as it is, be sure to stay on the trail tread as much as possible - yield by leaving your wheels on the trail and leaning outward, placing one foot down. And of course, when it's soft or muddy, stay on the trail too - braiding or widening the trail isn't going to make it more fun for anyone.</p><p>While you're there, you can't miss the old cistern along the trail. It's from Marshall's coal mining days. Don't fall in, you'd need a tall ladder to get out!</p>", "elevation_gain": 24.384, "cool_rating": 2.5, "difficulty_rating": 2, "tech_rating": 1.0, "id": "262", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Cowdrey Draw", "length": 1287.472, "aerobic_rating": 1.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/IMG_2134-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.199729919, 39.959148407]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
