not only because it was an existing trail west of Highway 93 to open, but also because it's a great route with good views and a wide variety terrain for the area.</p><p>It connects from the top of Flatirons Vista trail back down to its own trailhead located off Eldorado Drive. It junctions with both Community Ditch Trail and the recently built Springbook Loop along its way.</p><p>Up to Community Ditch, it's crusher fine, suitable for pretty much any mode of transportation, so expect to see a bunch of people. After that intersection, the rest of the climb is dirt. You'll start on a grassy hillside that gradually becomes more and more rocky along the way. When you get to the trail sign, you'll see the connector trail to the Springbrook Loop due west of you. There's a bit of repreieve from climbing as you continue south, but once you cross the creek (currently bridge-less following the September 2013 floods), the toughest section begins. Steep sections and embedded rocks make for some fun moves going up or down. After hitting the one switchback, you climb on an unfinished railroad grade from 100 years ago - it's a gentler slope, but has grown in with trees and some more rock moves. Head through the gate at the top, and you're on Flatirons Vista.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "elevation_gain": 135.636, "cool_rating": 2.5, "difficulty_rating": 3, "tech_rating": 2.5, "id": "263", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Doudy Draw", "length": 3540.5480000000002, "aerobic_rating": 2.0, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/101_4842ld-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.256515503, 39.937904358]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
