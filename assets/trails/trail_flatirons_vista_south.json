The trail starts out with a moderate climb up into the evergreens. After you get into the trees the trail comes together with the Prairie Vista Trail. Stay left to continue your journey around Flatirons Vista South. Once you go through the gate, the trail really picks up character. The trail winds through the evergreens and flows downhill all the way to Doudy Draw. This is the area where you need to keep your head up - deer can be seen here most of the year, and in the summer, you will see thousands of dandelions! This trail, as with all of the trails in the Marshall Mesa area, can be very busy with different user groups. Please be very courteous to all of them!</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "elevation_gain": 77.724, "cool_rating": 2.0, "difficulty_rating": 2, "tech_rating": 1.0, "id": "264", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "Flatirons Vista South", "length": 3862.4159999999997, "aerobic_rating": 1.5, "image_url": "https://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/022.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.235549927, 39.924301147]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
