There are couple each of short climbs (and a somewhat bigger one to the water tank on the Gunbarrel Trail), curving rollers and straight, moderate downhills. Meadowlarks frequent the fence posts in the open plains here; their call can be heard over the wind blowing through the grasses. You may also spot an occasional coyote.</p><p>Beware of the White Rocks Trail in the spring! Snowmelt turns the soil into slimy, tire jamming mud. The trail is generally heavily rutted right after it dries out, so stick to summer and fall if you like your trail smoother. The trail trail ruts present the only real technical challenge on this trail.</p><p>There are three access points for the White Rocks Trail and associated Gunbarrel Farm Trail: the Heatherwood neighborhood in Gunbarrel, 95 Street, and Valmont Drive. These trails aren't so far from town, and provide a nice place to escape for a shorter ride. This is also a good place for riders looking for a mellow introduction to riding on dirt.</p>", "elevation_gain": 48.768, "cool_rating": 1.5, "difficulty_rating": 1, "tech_rating": 1.0, "id": "389", "doc_type": "trail", "name": "East Boulder  (White Rocks)", "length": 3540.5480000000002, "aerobic_rating": 1.5, "image_url": "http://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/710x230/101_2437-1.JPG", "trailheads": {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.145874, 40.04010369]}, "type": "Feature"}]}}
